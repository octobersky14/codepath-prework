I would love to create an app that could teach music theory to younger audiences. It would be very interactive and open-ended enough to stress the freedom that may come from understanding the functions of musical elements. By the end, a song could be created...perhaps after the lesson, the user is taken into a "musical playground" where these songs can interact with each other.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

XCode was bugging and it took me way too long to realize the problem was that my computer wasn't updated.
